# Posted - a social media app

A project for final year computer science\
Project supervisor: Haoyi Wang

For social media users, who want their submissions/posts to be valued, Posted is an app
that will reward users in groups for top voted content. In contrast to established social medias
like reddit, Posted will have the ability for regular users to vote on moderated content (as
oppose to moderators).
